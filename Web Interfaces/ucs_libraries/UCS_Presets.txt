UCS Reaper Renaming Tool - User Presets

~~~
INSTRUCTIONS
- Fill out the information below, copying the fields for as many presets as needed.
- #Preset Name is the only mandatory field, and must be filled out for each preset. 
- If a preset is named "Default", it will automatically be loaded when the UCS renaming tool is loaded.
- All other fields are optional. 
- Do NOT remove field headers, even if the info in that field is blank.
- #Variation Numbers must be exactly "True" or "False", otherwise it will default to "True".
- Category, Subcategory, and File Name are not included, as they will likely differ for each file.
- Processing fields (#Items to Rename & #Search Area) must match the renaming tool's options exactly, see below:
