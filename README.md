# Aaron Cendan's ReaScripts For [REAPER](https://reaper.fm)
These scripts were written to add additional functionality to the digital audio workstation REAPER. As a sound designer and programmer with a concentration on audio for games, most of these scripts are tailored specifically towards a game audio workflow. If you would like to read more about the development of these scripts or some of the other projects I have worked on in the past, feel free to check out [my website!](https://www.aaroncendan.me/)

## ReaPack Download Instructions
Some of the scripts in this repository are imported natively in the [ReaPack REAPER extension](https://reapack.com/), the free scripts/packages download manager made by cfillion, as part of the [ReaTeam Scripts Repository](https://github.com/ReaTeam/ReaScripts). This means that you don't need to download and install the scripts manually, you can simply use ReaPack to batch download them right from REAPER!

To download or get the latest version of these scripts (see below), simply go to the Extensions menu > ReaPack, and click "Synchronize Packages".

### Scripts Included with ReaTeams
- acendan_Find and Replace in Region Names.lua
- acendan_Find and Replace in Marker Names.lua

## My GitHub ReaPack Installation (Optional)
If you would prefer to import ALL of the scripts here (including those that aren't packaged with ReaTeams), copy and paste the following URL in Extensions > ReaPack > Import a Repository:
> https://acendan.github.io/reascripts/index.xml

Some of the scripts here are experimental, and less stable than those uploaded in the ReaTeam Scripts repository. 

## Manual Download Instructions (Optional)
If you would prefer to download the scripts here manually, you can click on "Clone or Download", Download as ZIP, and then place the scripts anywhere you would like on your PC. I would recommend placing them within <AppData\Roaming\REAPER\Scripts\>, as they will get included whenever you export or backup your Reaper configuration.

## Special Thanks To

- [cfillion](https://cfillion.ca/): The creator of ReaPack, who has helped to ensure these scripts make it into the hands of far more Reaper users than I'd ever be able to reach solo.
