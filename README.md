# Aaron Cendan's ReaScripts for [REAPER](https://reaper.fm)
These scripts were written to add additional functionality to the digital audio workstation REAPER. As a sound designer and programmer with a concentration on audio for games, most of these scripts are tailored specifically towards a game audio workflow. If you would like to read more about the development of these scripts or some of the other projects I have worked on in the past, feel free to check out [my website!](https://www.aaroncendan.me/)

**All of the scripts in this repository can be imported directly in Reaper by using the [ReaPack REAPER extension](https://reapack.com/), the free scripts/packages download manager made by cfillion. I strongly recommend setting up ReaPack to install and use these scripts.**

## ReaTeams download instructions
Some of my scripts are included by default when installing ReaPack, as part of the [ReaTeam Scripts Repository](https://github.com/ReaTeam/ReaScripts). Simply install ReaPack and synchronize packages by going to the Extensions menu > ReaPack, and clicking "Synchronize Packages".

### Scripts included with ReaTeams
- acendan_Find and Replace in Region Names.lua

## Manual Download Instructions (Optional)
If you would prefer to download the scripts here manually, you can click on "Clone or Download", Download as ZIP, and then place the scripts anywhere you would like on your PC. I would recommend placing them within <AppData\Roaming\REAPER\Scripts\>, as they will get included whenever you export or backup your Reaper configuration.
